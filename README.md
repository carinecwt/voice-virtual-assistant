# Voice Virtual Assistant using ElevenLabs
This project is a real-time voice assistant built with the ElevenLabs API. It allows spoken conversations with an AI agent, using speech recognition and text-to-speech for natural interaction.

Project Description:
The assistant connects to ElevenLabs’ Conversational AI service and streams audio input/output in real time. Users can speak directly into their microphone, and the assistant responds with lifelike generated speech.

Key features:
- Real-time speech recognition
- Natural voice responses powered by ElevenLabs
- Personalized interaction flow (custom prompts and scheduling logic)
- Built with Python and PyAudio

Acknowledgments:
This project was adapted from the Codédex tutorial [**Create a Voice Virtual Assistant with ElevenLabs**](https://www.codedex.io/projects/create-a-voice-virtual-assistant-with-elevenlabs). 
The foundational API integration and conversation setup follow their guide, with additional customizations added for personalized functionality.
